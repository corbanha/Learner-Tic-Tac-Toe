# Learner-Tic-Tac-Toe
A GUI Java program that plays Tic Tac Toe games against itself until you can beat it!

This program was written in Java and has two different settings, the first option is to have the computer play any number of games against itself, and it keeps track of the losing boards as it plays and avoids those the next time. The second option is to play the computer yourself, at first it's fairly easy though over time it gets harder and harder to win against the computer as it learns all of the losing moves for it's side!
